## 🏷️ Labels to Use

To help organize discussions, please add the following labels to your issue:

* `reading-note` — if you're actively reading and sharing notes
* `discussion` — if you're posing questions or opening up conversations
* `question` — if you need help understanding part of the book
* `recommendation` — if you're proposing a new book to add

## 📬 How We Add Discussion Links

Each book entry in the list includes a `[📬 Join discussion]` link placed after its description. This link can direct users to the relevant GitHub Discussion or Issues page about that book. For example:

```markdown
[📬 Join discussion](https://github.com/ShouyeLiu/ReadingList/issues?q=Real+Mathematical+Analysis)
```

🛠️ Implementation notes:

* The link is placed at the end of each book item.
* It uses the book title as a search keyword.
* For now, it may serve as a placeholder until GitHub Discussions or Issue threads are created.
* Combined with the `🔖 reading` label, it allows tracking current readers.

If you'd like to automate this or link issues directly, you can request a maintainer to generate or tag discussion threads for specific books.

## 👥 Contributor Recognition

All contributors will be listed in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` (to be maintained by the repository owner). You can:

* Add your name and affiliation (optional)
* Mention the books or sections you helped with

If you're unsure how to update the file, just leave a comment or open an issue — we’ll help you add it.

---

## 📊 Monitor Discussion Activity

We are working on a dedicated webpage to display:

* Current readers and active issues
* Discussion frequency per book
* Top contributors and trending topics

This will be powered by the GitHub API and updated regularly.

If you’re experienced with frontend development or data viz and want to help, please reach out!

## 💡 Tips

* To link your issue to the book entry, just comment the URL under the corresponding book or request a maintainer to update the main list.
* You can track multiple readers on the same book by multiple issues (one per person).
* Feel free to remain anonymous in your notes if you prefer.

Happy reading and contributing!
